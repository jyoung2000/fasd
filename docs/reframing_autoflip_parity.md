# AutoFlip-Parity Reframing Changelog

Tracking progress toward full parity with Google AutoFlip
(Grundmann et al., "Auto-Directed Video Stabilization with Robust L1 Optimal Camera Paths").

## Baseline (pre-Phase 0)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Detected speaker changes | 9/9 (100%) | Synthetic 20s fixture, alternating every 2s |
| Missed changes | 0 | |
| Avg lag (frames @ 30fps) | 6.0 | Negative = anticipation (-6 frames = -200ms) |
| Max lag (frames) | 6 | |
| Min lag (frames) | 6 | |
| Sub-second switch recall | 100% (4/4) | 5 alternating 400ms segments |
| Overlap count | 0 | |
| Smoke test | PASSED | 1 segment, strategy=panning, 10s |
| L1 solver tests | 12/12 passed | test_l1_solver_constraints.py |

### Known issues (mapped to phases)

1. **Jitter during holds** — solver only penalizes velocity (no accel/jerk terms)
2. **2 Hz stair-stepping** — solver receives sparse anchors, not dense propagated trajectory
3. **~1s lag on transitions** — per-segment solving with no lookahead
4. **Pops at segment seams** — segments solved independently
5. **Chases keypoint noise** — TV_LAMBDA=10.0 too low, no dead-zone

## Phase 0 — Baseline telemetry

- Added CSV dump behind `CLIPAI_DUMP_L1=1` env flag → `/tmp/clipai_l1/<job_id>_<seg_idx>.csv`
- Added `backend/scripts/plot_l1_solve.py` for target-vs-solved visualization
- Baseline numbers recorded above

---

## Phase 1 — Dense propagated trajectory

*(to be filled after implementation)*

## Phase 2 — Condat exact 1D TV-L1

*(to be filled after implementation)*

## Phase 3 — Shot-level solving with lookahead

*(to be filled after implementation)*

## Phase 4 — LP solver with acceleration/jerk penalties

*(to be filled after implementation)*

---

## Out of scope (follow-ups)

- Multi-region tracking (AutoFlip handles multiple required regions with a unified LP)
- Cinematography "rule of thirds" bias
- Gameplay HUD-aware padding (orthogonal to solver quality, lives in layout_engine)
