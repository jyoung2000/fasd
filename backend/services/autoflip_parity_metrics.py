"""Phase 9 — AutoFlip parity metrics (pure-Python, no numpy / cv2 / ffmpeg).

These functions take simple Python data (lists of times, lists of crop
centers, ground-truth bbox tracks) and emit floats / ints / dicts.
They are deliberately decoupled from the reframe pipeline so they can
be unit-tested in isolation without the full numpy + OpenCV +
MediaPipe stack — every Phase-X PR can land its quality numbers by
running the runner script in docker and pasting the JSON into the
results doc, but the metric definitions themselves are testable in a
30-line sandbox.

The 8 metrics here implement the spec from the v2 plan:

    1. sub_second_switch_recall        — speaker change responsiveness
    2. overlap_count                   — segment-boundary invariant
    3. max_acceleration                — |Δ²x| on the crop path
    4. max_jerk                        — |Δ³x| on the crop path
    5. required_region_miss_rate       — % frames with a required bbox out of crop
    6. downbeat_snap_error             — music-video beat alignment
    7. hud_preservation_rate           — gaming HUD-zone visibility
    8. face_centroid_in_thirds_rate    — narrative / vlog rule-of-thirds bias

Coordinate convention: positions and bboxes are in **percentage of
source frame width** (0–100), matching the rest of the reframe
pipeline. Crop widths are also in % of source width. Timestamps are
in seconds.

Each function is total — empty-input edge cases return a sensible
default (1.0 for "everything passed", 0.0 for "no signal", or a dict
with ``None`` placeholders) so the runner can score every applicable
metric for every fixture without crashing on missing data.
