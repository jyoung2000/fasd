"""L1-optimal camera path solver for AutoFlip-quality reframing.

Solves a 1D total-variation denoising problem per segment to produce
"hold still, snap, hold still" or constant-velocity pan motion — the
signature of professional camera operation.

    min  (1/2) sum (cam[t] - target[t])^2  +  lambda * sum |cam[t] - cam[t-1]|
    s.t. min_x[t] <= cam[t] <= max_x[t]   (hard constraints from must_be_in_frame features)

Uses an exact dual proximal gradient TV solver (Chambolle 2004 / Condat 2013)
with per-solve box constraint projection. No iterative approximation —
produces exact piecewise-constant paths with zero residual tilt on holds.

Per-segment mode selection from the solved path:
  STATIONARY: max(path) - min(path) < threshold * source_width  -> static center
  TRACKING:   otherwise -> emit the L1 path as motion_path
  PANNING:    near-linear path (R^2 > 0.95) and |slope| > threshold -> sweep

    maximum horizontal glance deviation.

    Phase 4 — gaming mode adds a mandatory asymmetric clamp on
    top of whatever pan the solver produces: no frame's crop
    center may deviate from the horizontal source center by
    more than ``max_glance_deviation_pct * max_pan``, where
    ``max_pan = (source_width - crop_width) / 2``. Keeps at
    least part of the actual gameplay visible during HUD
    glances — without the clamp, a kill-feed glance on a 16:9

    Phase 3 — for a gaming shot that has zero or more
    :class:`gaming_event_detector.GamingEvent` markers, this helper
    blends the action anchor (typically the crosshair x or the
    per-genre action center) with each event's ``target_region``
    using a triangular temporal weight:

      - ``[T - ramp, T]``      → action weight ramps DOWN to
                                  ``action_hold_scale``,
                                  pan weight ramps UP from 0 to
                                  ``pan_weight_ratio``.
      - ``[T, T + duration]``  → pan weight held at full strength,
                                  action weight at ``action_hold_scale``.
      - ``[T + d, T + d + r]`` → both ramp back to baseline.

    The L1 solver's existing total-variation smoothness term keeps
    the transition smooth — no hand-rolled easing math required.

    Args:
        action_xy_pct: ``(x, y)`` baseline anchor in % of source.

            ``target_region != None`` produce a pan; ``None``
            target regions are treated as zoom-outs and skipped
            here — Phase 4's layout chooser handles those).
        start, end: Shot time range (seconds).
        target_fps: Output sample rate.
        pan_weight_ratio: Peak weight on the target during the
            hold, as a multiple of the baseline action weight (1.0).
        pan_hold_sec / pan_ramp_sec: Window shape.
        action_hold_scale: How much we attenuate the action
            anchor while panning (0 = full kill, 1 = no scaling).

    Returns:
        ``(positions, weights)`` parallel lists at uniform target_fps.
        ``positions`` is ``[(timestamp, x_pct), ...]`` and
        ``weights`` is the data-fidelity weight per frame (1.0 =

    """Build the center-biased gaming target stream for the L1 solver.

    Phase 3a — this is the canonical target builder for shots whose
    ``gameplay_subtype`` lives in :data:`CENTER_BIAS_GENRES`. It
    combines three anchor behaviors into a single per-frame
    ``(target_x, weight)`` stream the existing
    :func:`solve_camera_path` / :func:`solve_camera_path_for_shot`
    pipeline already consumes:

    1. **Hard center anchor (default).** Every frame starts with a
       unary term pulling toward ``target_x = 50`` (% of frame
       width) at weight :data:`GAMING_CENTER_WEIGHT_DEFAULT`. This
       is the safety net that guarantees a rollback to the
       rock-solid "center-crop the action" default whenever every
       other signal fails.

    2. **Per-frame crosshair override.** When the crosshair
       tracker entry at ``t`` carries
       ``confidence >= conf_threshold`` (default 0.6), the unary
       target switches to the tracked crosshair x and the weight
       rises to :data:`GAMING_CROSSHAIR_WEIGHT`. The center anchor
       is implicitly attenuated to
       :data:`GAMING_CENTER_WEIGHT_ACTIVE` in this frame — since
       the L1 solver consumes a single ``(target, weight)`` pair
       per frame, the effective anchor is the crosshair position
       at the higher weight (the attenuated center term is folded
       into the smoothness prior). On low-confidence or missing
       frames the crosshair override does NOT fire; saliency /
       motion / face-cluster anchors are NEVER consulted here by
       design.

    3. **Time-windowed pan anchor (gaming events).** For each
       :class:`gaming_event_detector.GamingEvent` with a
       ``target_region`` the helper blends the current anchor
       (center or crosshair) toward the region's centroid via a
       triangular temporal weight — 0.3 s ease-in, ``pan_hold_sec``
       hold at :data:`GAMING_PAN_WEIGHT`, 0.3 s ease-out. After the
       pan window closes the stream returns to the center/crosshair
       anchor and the solver's TV smoothness prior naturally eases
       the crop back over ~0.3-0.5 s.

    Args:
        crosshair_path: List of :class:`CrosshairFrame`-shaped
            objects (or ``(t, x, y, conf)`` tuples). May be empty
            or ``None`` — every frame falls back to hard center.
        events: List of :class:`GamingEvent` objects. Events whose
            ``target_region`` is ``None`` (zoom-out signals) are
            skipped here; Phase 4's layout chooser handles those.
        start, end: Shot time range (seconds).
        target_fps: Output sample rate.
        conf_threshold: Crosshair confidence floor to accept the
            per-frame override. Default
            :data:`GAMING_CROSSHAIR_CONF_THRESHOLD`.
        w_center_default / w_center_active: Center-anchor weights.
            Defaults from the :data:`GAMING_CENTER_WEIGHT_*` env
            vars.
        w_crosshair: Crosshair override weight. Default
            :data:`GAMING_CROSSHAIR_WEIGHT`.
        w_pan: Pan target weight during the hold. Default
            :data:`GAMING_PAN_WEIGHT`.
        pan_hold_sec / pan_ramp_sec: Pan window shape. Defaults
            from :data:`GAMING_PAN_HOLD_SEC` /
            :data:`GAMING_PAN_RAMP_SEC`.

        data-fidelity weights for the L1 unary term. Callers that
        want pixel coordinates should multiply by
